    "bio": "Hi! Welcome. My name is Nick. I am a Full-Stack Software Developer living in Seattle, Washington, with a background in Legal IT Consulting Management and Client Success. I am motivated by any opportunity to affect positive change with my work, but I have a particular passsion for learning new languages and building projects from the ground-up. I always attempt to apply an empathetic, collaborative approach to problem-solving and project work whenever possible, and I love working with others as nothing is more limiting long-term than a singular perspective. I have a growing project portfolio that I am attempting to add to monthly - feel free to check back in whenever and send me an email if you have any feedback. Thanks!"
