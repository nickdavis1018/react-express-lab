    "bio1": "Welcome! My name is Nick, and thanks for taking the time to check out my portfolio! I am a Full-Stack Software Developer living in Seattle, Washington, with a background in Legal IT Consulting Management and Client Success.",
    "bio2": "I have a particular passion for learning new languages and building projects from the ground-up, but I am motivated by any opportunity to affect positive change with my work. I always attempt to apply an empathetic, collaborative approach to problem-solving, as I find nothing to be more limiting than a singular perspective. I have a growing project portfolio that I routinely update - feel free to check back in whenever and send me an email if you have any feedback. Thanks!"
