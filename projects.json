For my first project, I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX to build an app that highlights these passions, by allowing users to search for dictionary word definitions, pronunciations, and oriigns. I also added a couple features to allow users to store favorite words as well as generate random words. Feel free to take a look around and provide feedback."

      "about": "For my second project, utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Node.js, and MongoDB, I built an app that lets users create an account, store private journal notes/reminders for themselves, as well as post public notes to the General Journal community. The application's main focus is to demonstrate knowledge of authentication and authorization while allowing for full CRUD functionality. Take a look around and feel free to pass along feedback!"
